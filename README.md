# Intructions on how to run the project

Once you have the dependencies installed

* You should see a Pokedex app running on port 3000 (unless you change it)
* Now it should load the pokemon.
* Click on each pokemon should give you the details page.
* Right click to see the details and add to favorites.
* Also you can filter the loaded pokemons by type.
* Clicking on the Pokedex icon should take back to home from any screen.
* Also I did all the code and no tests were included as I dont think I can spend more than a day of effort for this project. 
* I appreciate the challenge given and thank you for sending this to me.
* Even though I have planned my work and have it componentized, You might see a couple of big commits as I am still employed by my current company and I am working for them so I did push my code whenever i felt comfortable.
